## Motivation

As a team of passionate gamers and designers, we understand the transformative power of a dedicated game engine. All three of the members in the team enjoy playing game and game design, which is our motivation to create a tool that strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and powerful features, empowering indie developers and small studios to bring their creative visions to life without being overwhelmed by unnecessary complexity.

Rust's strong performance and memory safety make it ideal for building high-efficiency applications like game engines. However, despite the growing ecosystem, the Rust community currently lacks a game engine explicitly tailored for 2D game development. While general-purpose engines like Bevy and Amethyst offer impressive functionality, their dual focus on 2D and 3D game development introduces a layer of complexity and overhead that can feel unnecessary and daunting for developers focused exclusively on 2D games.

Our project is an opportunity to address this gap while immersing ourselves in a deeply satisfying and enjoyable development process. Building a 2D game engine allows us to combine our passion for game design, Rust, and systems programming. The challenge of creating something lightweight yet robust, simple yet feature-rich, sparks our creativity and pushes our technical expertise. Knowing we might be enabling indie creators to focus on their visions without being bogged down by unnecessary complexity also brings us joy.

This engine is designed to be a "dummy-can-use" toolâ€”intuitive enough for beginners to dive into game development while still providing advanced capabilities for experienced developers. By focusing solely on 2D, we eliminate the bloat and confusion that often come with multi-purpose engines, ensuring that every feature and optimization serves the unique needs of 2D game creators.

In essence, this project isn't just about building a game engine; it's about creating a space in the Rust ecosystem for indie developers and small studios to innovate, experiment, and succeed in the world of 2D game development.

## Objective

The primary objective of our Rust 2D Game Engine project is to create a lightweight, cross-platform engine that empowers developers to build 2D games with simplicity and efficiency. By focusing on modularity, performance, and an indie developer-friendly approach, the engine aims to provide an accessible and robust foundation for game development.

Our project emphasize:
#### Simplicity and Usability
Designing a user-friendly engine that lowers the barrier to entry for beginner game developers while supporting advanced use cases for experienced developers.

#### Performance and Scalability
Leveraging Rust's strengths in memory safety and high performance to ensure the engine is optimized for a wide range of 2D game projects, from small prototypes to larger, more complex games.

#### Modularity and Customization
Providing a flexible, modular architecture that allows developers to pick and integrate only the components they need, ensuring adaptability to different project requirements.

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility
Ensuring that games built with the engine can run seamlessly across multiple platforms, including desktop, web, and mobile environments.

#### Developer Empowerment
Streamlining the game development process by enabling rapid iteration and experimentation through intuitive tools, a Lua scripting system, and visual interfaces.

## User's Guide

In Rust, to integrate our Rendering Engine in your game:

```rust
use rust_2d_game_engine::render_engine::{RenderEngine, Sprite};

// Create renderer
let mut renderer = RenderEngine::new();

// Create sprites
let sprites = vec![
    Sprite {
        position: (100.0, 100.0),
        size: (50.0, 50.0),
        rotation: 0.0,
        texture_coords: (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0),
    },
    // Add more sprites as needed
];

// In the game loop
renderer.render_frame(&sprites).expect("Failed to render frame");
```

#### Concluding Remarks

Our Rust 2D Game Engine represents a promising first step into the world of specialized game development tools in Rust. While currently in its early prototype stage, the project has already demonstrated some good potential in addressing the unique needs of 2D game developers within the Rust ecosystem.

We have successfully laid a robust foundation, implementing core systems like the rendering engine, physics simulation, entity component system, and scripting support. The modular architecture and focus on performance and usability set the groundwork for a tool that could genuinely empower indie developers and small studios.

However, we recognize that this is just the beginning of our journey. The current iteration, while functional, is a proof of concept that requires continued refinement, expansion, and community feedback. Our roadmap includes:

- Expanding the feature set to support more complex game development scenarios
